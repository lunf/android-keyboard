Why
====

I hated when I mistype something on the phone and it takes time to goes back and fixes it. The most errors that I have made is the space bar is too short and there is a period button next to it and I always hit the period button. Android is open system and it allow user to use any keyboard that suit their need so why not and how hard can it be?


Ideas
====

The keyboard contains required key for typing and special key will be hidden away. I want the keyboard as simple as possible.

To do this, I've copied the iOS key pad and add some small tweeks that I preferred.

To Do
====

* Copy style from iOS keyboard

For future plan
====

* Can accept Vietnamese language
* Have designer to design each button for better looking.

Nah
====

* I do not like auto suggestions, or suggestion bar. If you want it, please fork my code
